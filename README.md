# TESS
## TESS
TESS is an Adafruit Feather compatible embedded Linux board based on the Allwinner T113-S3 SoC with 128MB of DDR3 RAM built-in. We did add some pins that are not in the original spec, these allow for USB and debug UART to be available on regular pinheaders. This SoC does however only have 1 ADC pin availble that is even limited to 1.8V, so the extra analog pins are replaced by digital pins with various mux options. Allowing for multiple IÂ²C busses, UARTs and CAN interfaces to be used.
Some key features of TESS REV 00 are:
- [Allwinner T113-S3 SoC](https://linux-sunxi.org/T113-s3) with dual core Cortex A7 running at 1.2GHz and 128 MB DDR3 RAM
- 512 MB SD-storage soldered down
- [ESP32-C3-MINI-1](https://www.espressif.com/en/module/esp32-c3-mini-1-en) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module
- battery charger (up to 1.2A selectable in software)
- Microphone
- 3 user LEDs
- [RPI Touch Display 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/touch-display-2/) compatible DSI connector
